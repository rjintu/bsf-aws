Many thanks to Sunny Kumar of Black Sheep Foods for his continued support and guidance.

This project was inspired by the work of Tshitoyan et al. in [Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec). We utilized their `process.py` processor on the abstracts to improve the classifier's accuracy. Our preprocessing pipeline was also designed based on their suggestions. 

Many articles in the dataset were sourced from the [S2ORC: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.447).
